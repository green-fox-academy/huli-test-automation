# huli-test-automation
An environment equipped with tools for Python, C#, Java and JavaScript developers who wish to work with automated tests.

## Prequisites
All you need is Docker on your local machine and a text editor.

## Get Started
If you are using this repo you will need to build the dockerfile then run it, alternatively you can use the docker-compose.yml file. In case you are pulling the image from DockerHub just do so and run it.

You can access the running container's CLI like so:
````
docker exec -it [container id] bash
````

Once you are in, you can try the pre-written samples for Java, Node.js, C# and Python (find them in the respective directories).

## Start coding
Feel free to write your own code and test in the language you prefer!
